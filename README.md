# The scripts of the article: Chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved genome assembly of Hyotissa hyotis
These scripts were used to generate the analyses.
Details of the methods are in the paper.
Contact: C. Shi <shichenyu@stu.ouc.edu.cn> and S. Liu <liushk@ouc.edu.cn>
Note: these scripts are internal to this project, and not currently designed for generic use, so results are not guaranteed for adaptation in other work

## Experimental Design
1. Individual genome assembly with PacBio HiFi data and Hi-C data
2. Genome annotation with RNA-seq data
